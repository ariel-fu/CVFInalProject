Pseudocode for Pierre - two array method

1. create an integer that will be the the length of the new array 
2. run through every number in the pages to find the largest number
3. create a new array with the length of max (the integer we create in 1.)
4. create a for loop that will run through the new array and count how many of each number we have
(reasoning behing 4.) everytime the same number shows up, it will put that many of it into the corresponding index
ex: {1,9,2,6,6,8,2,1} --> {0,2,2,0,0,0,2,0,1,1} so two 1s, 2 6s, one 8, and one 9.
5. run a nested for loop --- first for loop: runs from 0-array.length
							 second for loop: runs from 0-how many of each number there is
ex: {0,2,2,0,0,0,2,0,1,1}; --> first for loop: runs through 9 times
							   second for loop: (example at index 1) runs through twice(there are two 1s) 
6. adds 1 to the currValue (the current value we are plugging into pages (our sorted array))
7. returns pages (the sorted array)
