Pseudocode for Pierre - two for loops method

public static int[] sort(int[] pages){
if is in order then quit

int arrLength = pages.length;
	for(int i=0...Length){
		for(int j=0...length-1){
			if(pages[j+1] < pages[j]){
				swap pages[j] and pages[j+1];
			}
		}
	}
}

The code starts by checking if the array is already sorted. If it is, return the original array. 
I will use a for loop to runs through each element and compare the element with its next neighbor. 
If the neighbor is smaller then swap the 2. This sort the smallest element to the front of the array.
Then, using another for loop to repeat the loop above for all elements until all elements are sorted from the smallest to the largest.
