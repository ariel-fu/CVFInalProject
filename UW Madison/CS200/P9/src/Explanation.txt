Pseudocode for Pierre - two for loops method

public static int[] sort(int[] pages){
if is in order then quit

int arrLength = pages.length;
	for(int i=0...Length){
		for(int j=0...length-1){
			if(pages[j+1] < pages[j]){
				swap pages[j] and pages[j+1];
			}
		}
	}
}

The code starts by checking if the array is already sorted. If it is, return the original array. 
I will use a for loop to run through each element and compare the element with its next neighbor. 
If the neighbor is smaller then swap the 2. This sorts the smallest element to the front of the array.
Then, using another for loop to repeat the loop above for all the elements until all elements are sorted from the smallest to the largest.

This sorting algorithm works because it goes through every element and sorts them individually.
It takes one element at a time and place it behind all numbers greater than it but in front of numbers smaller than it.
