- add a Label in the top panel, that says "CS400 My First JavaFX Program"
- add a ComboBox in the left panel, that shows a drop down box with three or more items that can be selected. 
(selecting does not have to do anything for this program. Tip: google "JavaFX ComboBox")
- add an ImageView of an Image in the center panel (Tip: google "JavaFX ImageView")
(image file must be copied to your project and the image must be a photo or drawing of your face)
- add a Button in the bottom panel with the label "Done"
(button does not have to, but can be programmed to close window)
